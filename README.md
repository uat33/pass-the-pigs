# pass-the-pigs


This is an online version of pass the pigs with a dice, meant to be played by two players.

Rules

    1. Player 1 starts
    2. Each player has two scores: A current score and a total score.
    3. In each turn a dice is rolled. If a 1 is rolled, the current score of the player who rolled it becomes 0, and it becomes the other player's turn. 
    4. If anything other than a 1 is rolled, that value is added to the player's current score.
    5. At the end of each roll (assuming a 1 was not rolled), the player has the option to either keep rolling or hold.
    6. When a player holds, their current score is added to their total score and it becomes the other player's turn. 
    7. The first player to get a total score of 100 wins.
    8. Each time a new game starts, the other player gets the first turn.
